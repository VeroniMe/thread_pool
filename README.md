Thread Pool
===========
This is a implementation of a simple thread pool.
>“A thread pool is a design pattern where a number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually organized in a queue. Typically, there are many more tasks than threads. As soon as a thread completes its task, it will request the next task from the queue until all tasks have been completed. The thread will then sleep until there are new tasks available.”
